    "#### Think of a classification problem from your own experience and interest (e.g., distinguishing between two types of things/living beings/weather/personality/vehicle/industry/sports/houses/professionals etc.). Collect some real- world data to solve that classification problem. Have at least two classes, two attributes and at least 5 instances per class. Create a dataframe with this data and paste a screenshot of it. Also give a short description of the data (number of instances, number of attributes and the list of attributes, list of classes, and creator: Your name). The attributes should be numerical.\n",
    "#### The classification problem should be a new one, but the dataset may contain data that are new (generated by you by any rough measurements) or collected from public domain. Please cite the references/sources from which you collect the data."
